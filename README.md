# TBASIC
Legacy Code from my dad

While cleaning the room of my dad, who recently passed away, I found these BASIC programs on old floppy disks.
These code snippets are from my dad, who was into programming in the late 80s.

I don't know which computer he had but I still have his C64 and also an old Toshiba.

I want to archive all his code he made and publish it here for free, if somebody still even works with BASIC. Probably less than 1%.
I still need to dive deeper what these programs used to make. I never programmed in BASIC, nor do I know what these apps used to do.

### HFBERECH 
This is something for calculating high frequency for his hobby amateur radio.

### DIARIO 
Probably a small text editor for writing Diary

### KOPFRE 
KOPFRE means Kopfrechnen in German - or Mental math in English. As a math teacher, this was obvious to program :D
